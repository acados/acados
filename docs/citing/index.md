## Publications on advanced `acados` features:
If you are using some of the following advanced features of `acados`, please additionally cite the corresponding publications.

### Fast integrators with sensitivity propagation for use in CasADi
This paper demonstrates the efficiency of `acados` integrators, compared with integrators available in CasADi.
Additionally it describes the [`casados-integrator`](https://github.com/FreyJo/casados-integrators) a wrapper which allows using the `acados` integrators within a `CasADi` NLP solver, like IPOPT.

}
```


### Advanced-Step Real-Time Iterations (AS-RTI)
Advanced-step real-time iterations provide an extension to the classic real-time iteration algorithm, which allows to performs additional multi-level iterations in the preparation phase, such as inexact or zero-order SQP iterations on a problem with a predicted state estimate.

This feature can be used by setting the options `as_rti_level` and `as_rti_level`.

### Gauss-Newton Runge-Kutta (GNRK) integrators for efficient discretization of OCPs with long horizons and least-squares costs

The GNRK integration scheme can be used by setting the option `cost_discretization = 'INTEGRATOR'`.
This paper additionally demonstrates the effectiveness of using nonuniform discretization grids, and in particular in combination with GNRK.
