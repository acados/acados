## Software interfaced with `acados`
- [Rockit (Rapid Optimal Control kit)](https://gitlab.kuleuven.be/meco-software/rockit)
is a software framework to quickly prototype optimal control problems.
Notably, the software allows free end-time problems and multi-stage optimal problems.
The software is currently focused on direct methods and relies heavily on `CasADi`.
`acados` is interfaced as a `Rockit` solver by building on top of the Python interface of `acados`.

- [TuneMPC - a Python package for economic tuning of nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) problems.](https://github.com/jdeschut/tunempc/)

- [OpenOCL](https://github.com/OpenOCL/OpenOCL)
is an open-source Matlab toolbox for modeling and solving optimal control problems.
It can use `CasADi` with IPOPT as a solver.
It also provides a higher level interface to `acados`, which is based on the Matlab interface of `acados`.

- [bioptim - a Python library for optimal control in biomechanics.](https://github.com/pyomeca/bioptim)
