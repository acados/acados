Fast and embedded solvers for nonlinear optimal control.

- `acados` __source code__ is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/acados/acados).
Contributions via Pull requests are welcome!

- `acados` has a discourse based [__forum__](https://discourse.acados.org/).

- `acados` is mainly developed by the group around Prof. Moritz Diehl, the Systems Control and Optimization Laboratory (__syscop__), at the University of Freiburg. [More infos on the syscop web page](https://www.syscop.de/).


# About `acados`

`acados` is a software package for the efficient solution of optimal control and estimation problems.
<!-- It is the successor of the [`ACADO`](https://acado.github.io/) software package developed at KU Leuven and University of Freiburg by the team of Prof. Moritz Diehl. -->
It provides a collection of computationally efficient building blocks tailored to optimal control and estimation problems.
Among others, it implements:
- modules for the integration of ordinary differential equations (ODE) and differential-algebraic equations (DAE),
- interfaces to state-of-the-art QP solvers like [`HPIPM`](https://github.com/giaf/hpipm), `qpOASES`, [`DAQP`](https://github.com/darnstrom/daqp) and [`OSQP`](https://github.com/oxfordcontrol/osqp),
- (partial) condensing routines
- nonlinear programming solvers for optimal control structured problems
- real-time algorithms, such as the real-time iteration (RTI) and Advanced-Step Real-time iteration (AS-RTI) algorithms
The back-end of acados uses the high-performance linear algebra package [`BLASFEO`](https://github.com/giaf/blasfeo), in order to boost computational efficiency for small to medium scale matrices typical of embedded optimization applications.
`MATLAB`, `Octave` and `Python` interfaces can be used to conveniently describe optimal control problems and generate self-contained C code that can be readily deployed on embedded platforms.

### Fast integrators with sensitivity propagation for use
This paper demonstrates the efficiency of `acados` integrators, compared with integrators available in CasADi.
Additionally it describes the [`casados-integrator`](https://github.com/FreyJo/casados-integrators) a wrapper which allows using the `acados` integrators within a `CasADi` NLP solver, like IPOPT.
