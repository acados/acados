# Interfaces


## C API
The C API of `acados` is an efficient interface to the core functionalities of `acados`.
It provides setters and getters that can be used to interact with the core of `acados` with
negligible computation overhead. In order to learn about the `acados` C API, you
can look at the examples in
[`acados/examples/c/`](https://github.com/acados/acados/tree/master/examples/c).

## MATLAB/Octave (rapid prototyping)

This interface makes a broad set of `acados` functionalities available from Matlab or Octave.
As of now, this closely tracks the latest developments in the core of acados, e.g.
exact Hessians, adjoint corrections, regularization, etc.

To get started with this interface we recommend the examples in `<acados_root>/examples/acados_matlab_octave/getting_started`.

The problem formulation is stated in [this PDF](https://github.com/acados/acados/tree/master/docs/problem_formulation/problem_formulation_ocp_mex.pdf).

The explanation of the various options can be found also in a spreadsheet style at this [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rVRycLnCyaWJLwnV47u30Vokp7vRu68og3OhlDbSjDU/edit?usp=sharing) (thanks to [@EnricaSo](https://github.com/EnricaSo)).


This interface uses the shared libraries created using the make command from the main `acados` folder

```bash
make shared_library
```

To run the examples, navigate into the selected folder, and there run the command
```
export ACADOS_INSTALL_DIR="<acados_root>"
source env.sh # Which can be found in the folder of one of the examples
```

If `ACADOS_INSTALL_DIR` is not specified, it will be assumed that the examples are run from the sub-folders of the current folder (i.e. `acados` main folder is 2 folders up from the current folder).

Afterwards, launch `Matlab` or Octave from the same shell.

If you want to run the examples in a different folder, please close the current shell and open a new one to repeat the procedure: this ensures the correct setting of the environment variables.

## MATLAB/Octave (templates, Work In Progress)
There is the option to generate embeddable `C` code from Matlab.
The workflow uses the same templates as the Python interface (see below) and the `Tera` renderer.
After creating an acados solver `ocp`, you can use the routine `ocp.generate_c_code` to generate `C` code which can be used for embedded applications.

Note: This part of the MATLAB/Octave interface does not yet support all features of the one mentioned before.

## Python (templates)

`acados_template` is a Python package that can be used to specify optimal control problems from Python and to generate self-contained C code that uses the acados solvers to solve them.
The pip package is based on templated code (C files, Header files and Makefiles), which are rendered from Python using the templating engine `Tera`.
The genereated C code can be compiled into a self-contained C library that can be deployed on an embedded system.

### Optimal Control Problem description
The Python interface relies on the same problem formulation as the MATLAB interface [see here](https://github.com/acados/acados/blob/master/docs/problem_formulation/problem_formulation_ocp_mex.pdf).

### Installation
1. Compile and install `acados` by running:
```bash
cd <acados_root>/build
cmake -DACADOS_WITH_QPOASES=ON ..
make install -j4
```

2. Install acados_template Python package by running
```
pip3 install <acados_root>/interfaces/acados_template
```
Note: If you are working with a virtual Python environment, use the `pip` corresponding to this Python environment instead of `pip3`.

3. Add the path to the compiled shared libraries `libacados.so, libblasfeo.so, libhpipm.so` to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (default path is `<acados_root/lib>`) by running:
```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:"<acados_root>/lib"
```
Tipp: you can add this line to your `.bashrc`/`.zshrc`.

4. Run a Python example to check that everything works.
We suggest to get started with the example
`<acados_root>/examples/acados_python/getting_started/minimal_example_ocp.py`.

5. Optional: Can be done automatically through the interface:
In order to be able to successfully render C code templates, you need to download the `t_renderer` binaries for your platform from <https://github.com/acados/tera_renderer/releases/> and place them in `<acados_root>/bin` (please strip the version and platform from the binaries (e.g.`t_renderer-v0.0.34 -> t_renderer`).
Notice that you might need to make `t_renderer` executable.
Run `export ACADOS_SOURCE_DIR=<acados_root>` such that the location of acados will be known to the Python package at run time.

6. Optional: Set `acados_lib_path`, `acados_include_path`.
If you want the generated Makefile to refer to a specific path (e.g. when cross-compiling or compiling from a location different from the one where you generate the C code), you will have to set these paths accordingly in the generating Python code.
