### Guidelines for good pull requests (PR)

- Concise description on why you suggest a specific change.
- Reasonable size, ideally one feature/fix per PR
- For new options, functions and properties in high-level interfaces: Describe what they are and how to use them in the docs and in the PR description.
- Don't add trailing white spaces.
- For new features and ideally bug fixes: modify existing tests or add new ones, that run on CI.
