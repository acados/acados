### Linear MPC for a quadcopter

This example implements a linear MPC controller based on the [quadcopter example from OSQP's website](https://osqp.org/docs/examples/mpc.html). More details about the origin of the model can be found [here](https://github.com/orgs/osqp/discussions/558).

The aim of the example is to be simple - for more details and an extended list of solver options, please take a look at the [problem formulation document](https://github.com/acados/acados/blob/master/docs/problem_formulation/problem_formulation_ocp_mex.pdf) or the `getting_started` folder.
