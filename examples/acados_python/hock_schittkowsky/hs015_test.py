#
# This is Charlie Vanarets favorite problem since filterSQP it is small, but
# filterSQP requires the feasibility restoration to solve the problem
#
# Problem is in two dimension

# min 100*(x2 - x1^2)^2 + (1 - x1)^2

# s.t.  x1*x2 >= 1

# Optimal solution is x* = (0.5, 2), and optimal objective is f^*=306.5
